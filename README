This script allows to keep your /usr/portage ( or any other dir ) on squashfs image backed up by writable branch on aufs/unionfs.

The repository contains two preconfigured variations for gentoo portage tree and overlays.

When stop is called, the squashfs image is rebuilt from contents of merged squashfs/{aufs,unionfs} directory.

TODO: 
- test recent changes
- move config to conf.d files
